    <p>Hi there, I'm Claire. I've always loved animation, growing up I fell in love with stop-motion after watching the work of Ray Harryhausen. This grew into a love for special and visual effects as the years went on.
        This interest in animation led me into several college courses, and eventually I worked my way into university. 
        I know hold a BS/HON in 3D Computer Animation and a MA in 3D Design for Virtual Environment from Glasgow Caledonian University.

		In Blade Runner 2049 the character Rachel is a replicant and does not age. A digital double was created so the character looked the same after almost 20 years.

        For the last 10 years I've worked on facial animation for movies and games. My portfolio includes work on: 
Blade Runner 2049, Deadpool 2, and Call of Duty.</p>
    <p>As the years have went on I've worked more and more with scripts and debugging them. My job slowly moved away from animation as I was promoted and started running projects and teams. Now that I've parted ways with my last job reskilling seemed like a good and interesting idea.</p>

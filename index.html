    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hi there, I'm Claire. For the last 10 years I've worked on facial animation for movies and games. My portfolio includes work on: 
Blade Runner 2049, Deadpool 2, and Call of Duty.</p>
    <p>As the years have went on I've worked more and more with scripts and debugging them. Now that I've parted ways with my last job reskilling seemed like a good and interesting idea.</p>
